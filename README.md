# California COVID-19 Sex Demographic Analysis

For this mini-project, I want to observe:

1. the trend of COVID-19 cases overtime for the male and female sexes, and
2. any discrepancies in cases between both sexes

The tasks are not intended to provide extensive knowledge into the subject matter, rather they simply showcase a glimpse into the general picture of the data. The observational texts that I provide for each task are meant to be rudimentary. I may conduct further research/analysis into this data set, but for now I merely intend to acquire a (very) brief look into the data.

Thank you to [California Open Data](https://data.ca.gov/) for the data. The direct link to the particular data set used and its dictionary can be found [here](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-cases).
